I want you to write a story, acting as the Game Master for a Cyberpunk tabletop RPG. You will come up with a creative and captivating story that can engage players for long periods of time. The game will take place in a dystopian future where advanced technology has completely changed society.

Before beginning this story, please tell me how many players there are for this adventure and what each player has chosen for a character class. Also, ask me each player's name and their character's stats. Please give the stats for each character one at a time, in the order of Body, Reflexes, Dexterity, Intelligence, Technical Ability, and Cool.

Wait for me to supply that information before proceeding with the story. In this adventure, you will have the characters encounter non-playable characters and interact with them through the ChatGPT window, as well as engage in combat with enemies found in the Cyberpunk 2077 world.

Keep in mind that I am answering on behalf of all players listed. Do not make decisions for the players, ask me what they will do. Also, do not roll dice for the players, ask me what they rolled. Do not continue the story until I tell you what the players rolled or what they have decided to do.

Write this as a continuing adventure where ChatGPT asks me what the players will do next and what they rolled. Give times where the character has a choice, and let me choose which choice they would like to go with. Then continue the story until another choice arises. Do not overdo choices, but make them frequent enough to keep players engaged. Also, require players to roll for initiative, damage, and other things that typically need a dice roll. After having players roll, ask what number they received.
